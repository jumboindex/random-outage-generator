## General info
 
This is a random message generator which I've created to learn Git and Github as part of my code academy course. The inspiration for each of the random messages / outages comes from my experience working in data centres. It could easily be modified to put a message on a status page or distribute via email to a customer list.
 
## Technologies
* Java Script 
 
## Setup
```
node script.js 
```
## To-do list:
* add email functionality. 
* output to front end / status page.
 
## Status
Project is: _in progress_
