## General info

This is a random message generator which I have created to learn Git and Github as part of my code accedemy course. The inspiration for each of the random messages / outages comes from my experience working in data centres (yes this has all happened at undisclosed companies). It could easily be modified to generate random service outages to put on a status page or distribute via email to a customer list.
